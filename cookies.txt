Ingredients:

1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined.

Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

Drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

Bake in the preheated oven for 9-11 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Be careful not to overbake; the center should still be soft.

Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies!
